NetProxy package for Ultimate++
--------------------------------

This delegate class, formerly known as NetworkProxy, encapsulates two widely used network 
proxy protocols: Http tunneling and SOCKS.

Features and Highlights
-----------------------

- Uses HTTP_CONNECT method for http tunneling.
- Encapsulates SOCKS proxy protocol version 4/4a, and version 5, as defined in RFC 1928 and RFC 1929. 
- In SOCKS mode, NetProxy can work with both IPv4 and IPv6 address families.
- In SOCKS mode, NetProxy allows BIND requests.
- In SOCKS mode, NetProxy allows remote name lookups (DNS).
- Supports both synchronous and asynchronous operation modes.
- Allows SSL connections to the target machine (not to proxy itself) in both Http and SOCKS modes.
- Package comes with full public API document for Topic++, and has a typical BSD license.

Known Issues
-----------------------

- In SOCKS mode, NetProxy currently does not allow UDP association.

History
-----------------------

- 2017-11-07: GetWaitEvents() and AddTo() methods are added.
              These methods are intented to simplify waiting on client socket in non-blocking mode.

- 2017-09-23: Initial release of version 2.0:
              A change in naming: NetworkProxy is from now on called NetProxy.
              This change is in parallel with the change in class design.
              There is now a single class that can make both HTTP_CONNECT and SOCKS requests.
              Handling of socks BIND requests is simplified.
              Internal cleanup redesigne allowed some performance gain around %4.
